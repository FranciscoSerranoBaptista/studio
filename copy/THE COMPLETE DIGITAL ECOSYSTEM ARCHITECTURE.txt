# **PART I: THE ECOSYSTEM STRATEGY**

## **The Fundamental Architecture:**

```
AWARENESS â†’ VALIDATION â†’ CONVERSION â†’ DELIVERY

LinkedIn/Bluesky â†’ Instagram â†’ Website â†’ Assessment
   â†‘                    â†‘           â†‘
CoachHub/Ezra â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜           â”‚

```

Each platform has ONE job. Not two. Not three. ONE.

# **PART II: SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS**

## **LINKEDIN: The Authority Platform**

### **Primary Function: VALIDATION**

Executives who hear about you come here first.
This is your credibility checkpoint.

### **The Psychology:**

**They're asking:**
- Is this person legitimate?
- Do they work at my level?
- What do others say about them?
- Can I trust them with my career?

### **Profile Architecture:**

**Headline (220 characters max):**
```
Executive Transition Architect | â‚¬50M+ P&L Leaders | 87% Success Rate | First 100 Days Specialist
```
- No coach/coaching language
- Specific qualification threshold
- Outcome metric upfront
- Urgency indicator (100 days)

**About Section (2,000 characters):**
```
I prevent executive failure in high-stakes transitions.

200+ senior executives. 15 countries. 87% success rate.

The Problem:
40% of executive transitions fail within 18 months.
Cost: â‚¬2.5M per failure. Career derailment. Organizational disruption.

The Cause:
Not competence. Integration failure.
Brilliant executives failing because they can't navigate 
the hidden architecture of executive success.

The Solution:
Executive Integration Architectureâ„¢
Systematic methodology identifying and integrating competing 
internal forces that create external friction.

I work exclusively with:
â€¢ â‚¬50M+ P&L responsibility
â€¢ 100+ person organizations
â€¢ Board/ExCo reporting relationships
â€¢ First 18 months or significant expansion

Recent Outcomes:
â€¢ Swiss Pharma EVP: Board succession accelerated 18 months
â€¢ German Banking MD: "Failing" to "exceptional" in 90 days
â€¢ Technology CDO: Team attrition 30% to 8%

Process:
90-minute Strategic Assessment for qualified executives.
3-6 month integration programs.
3 executives per quarter maximum.

Currently accepting assessments for Q2 2025.

```

### **Content Strategy:**

**Post Types (Weekly Rotation):**

**Monday: Pattern Recognition**
```
"Executive Failure Pattern #3: The Intensity Override

Saw this again last week:
Brilliant executive. Single emotional register.
Every meeting at 11/10 intensity.
Team exhausted by day 60.

The fix isn't less intensity.
It's contextual deployment.

Your greatest strength becomes your visible weakness
when applied without calibration."

#ExecutiveTransition #LeadershipFailure #100Days
```

**Wednesday: Contrarian Take**
```
"Your board didn't hire you to be authentic.
They hired you to deliver results.

Authenticity without integration is just stubbornness
with a better PR strategy.

The question isn't 'How can I be myself?'
It's 'Which version of myself serves this context?'"
```

**Friday: Client Insight (Anonymized)**
```
"'My eye stopped twitching. The sleep disorders stopped.
But more importantly, I stopped creating my own resistance.'

â€” Technology Executive, Month 3 of transition

Physical symptoms are data.
Your body keeps score of transition stress."
```

### **Engagement Strategy:**

**Never:**
- Like random posts (desperate)
- Comment generically ("Great post!")
- Share without adding value
- Post daily (overexposure)

**Always:**
- Comment with contrarian expertise
- Share with substantial reframe
- Post 2-3x/week maximum
- Time for executive viewing (7-8am, 5-6pm CET)

### **Connection Strategy:**

**Accept connections from:**
- Current executives only
- Board members
- Executive recruiters
- Past clients

**Decline connections from:**
- Coaches (competition)
- Vendors (noise)
- Random networkers
- Sub-executive level

**Never send connection requests.**
Let them come to you.

## **INSTAGRAM: The Humanity Platform**

### **Primary Function: HUMANIZATION**

Show you're a real person, not just a methodology.

### **The Psychology:**

**They're asking:**
- Is this person relatable?
- Do they understand life beyond work?
- Can I spend 90 minutes with them?
- Are they all work or dimensional?

### **Profile Setup:**

**Bio (150 characters):**
```
Executive Transition Architect
200+ leaders | 87% success
Based: Lausanne ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­
Not about the journey. About arrival.
```

**Link:**
```
linktr.ee/franciscobaptista
â†’ Executive Assessment
â†’ LinkedIn
â†’ Diagnostic PDF
```

### **Content Strategy:**

**Post Types (2x/week max):**

**Professional Wisdom:**
- Photo: You at desk, deep focus
- Caption: "Day 47 of an executive transition. This is when the antibodies activate. The organization tests whether you're serious about change. Most executives blink. The ones who don't become the success stories."

**Life/Work Integration:**
- Photo: Morning coffee, Lausanne view
- Caption: "5:47am. Preparing for a diagnostic with a German manufacturing exec. The first 100 days determine everything. But first, Portuguese coffee ritual."

**Pattern in Nature:**
- Photo: Swiss mountains
- Caption: "Mountains don't negotiate with weather. Executives shouldn't negotiate with reality. Work with what is, not what should be."

### **What NEVER to Post:**

- Inspirational quotes over sunsets
- "Grateful" posts
- Workout photos
- Food pictures
- Family (privacy)
- Vacation (except if working)
- Anything coaches post

### **Stories Strategy:**

**Use stories for:**
- Behind-scenes of assessments (anonymous)
- Book you're reading (business only)
- Walking between sessions (movement)
- Never use stickers, polls, questions

---

## **BLUESKY: The Thought Leadership Platform**

### **Primary Function: INTELLECTUAL POSITIONING**

Where you can be more provocative than LinkedIn.

### **The Psychology:**

**Early adopters asking:**
- Is this person thinking differently?
- Are they ahead of the curve?
- Do they have original thoughts?

### **Profile Setup:**

**Bio:**
```
Executive transitions. 40% fail. I prevent yours from being one.
No coaching. Architecture.
francisco@franciscobaptista.com
```

### **Content Strategy:**

**Post Types (Daily):**

**Morning Provocation:**
```
"Every executive who failed told me the organization was 
the problem. Every executive who succeeded worked with 
reality as it was. The difference? Architecture, not attitude."
```

**Afternoon Analysis:**
```
"Watching another 'authentic leadership' course launch.
Authentication without integration is just stubbornness.
Your board wants results, not your journey."
```

**Evening Thread:**
```
"Thread: The 5 ways executives create their own failure

1/ The Competence Trap: Solving instead of leading...
2/ The Intensity Override: One gear for all terrains...
[Continue...]"
```

### **The Bluesky Advantage:**

- Less corporate oversight
- More intellectual audience
- Can be edgier
- Links don't suppress reach
- Threading works well

---

# **PART III: CLOSED PLATFORMS (Third-Party)**

## **The Fundamental Challenge:**

You're competing with 10,000 other coaches.
You must be findable, credible, and different.
But you can't control the platform.

---

## **ACEUP: Premium Executive Platform**

### **Profile Positioning:**

**Title:**
```
Executive Transition Specialist | First 100 Days
```
(Not "coach" - everyone is a coach)

For executives with â‚¬50M+ P&L facing complex stakeholder 
dynamics. Not coachingâ€”systematic intervention.

200+ senior executives. 15 countries. 12 years.
```

**The Psychology:**

AceUp users are often company-sponsored.
They didn't choose to be here.
They're skeptical.

**Your angle:** Results, not relationship.

---

## **BETTERUP: The Wellness-Washing Platform**

### **The Challenge:**

BetterUp leans heavily into wellbeing, growth mindset, authenticity.
You need to translate without diluting.

**Profile Adaptation:**

**Title:**
```

**Bio Reframe:**
```
Helping senior executives integrate all aspects of 
leadership for sustainable success.

Specialty: Navigating complex transitions while maintaining 
personal effectiveness and organizational impact.

stakeholder dynamics, and leadership identity.

For senior leaders ready to move beyond surface change 
to architectural transformation.
```

**The Code-Switching:**

Use their language, maintain your positioning:

- "Authentic self" â†’ "Integrated leadership"
- "Growth mindset" â†’ "Systematic development"

---

## **COACHHUB: The Volume Platform**

### **The Reality:**

CoachHub is McDonald'sâ€”volume, efficiency, scale.
You're positioning as the boutique option.

**Profile Strategy:**

**Title:**
```
Senior Executive Specialist
```

**Unique Differentiator:**
```
EXCLUSIVE FOCUS: Executive transitions above â‚¬50M P&L

Unlike generalist coaches, I work solely with senior 
executives navigating high-stakes role transitions.

executive transitions. No life coaching. No general 
leadership development. Just systematic architecture 
for executives where failure isn't an option.

Minimum requirement: Board-level exposure.
```

**Session Descriptions:**

Don't offer standard packages. Only:
```
"Executive Transition Diagnostic - 90 minutes"
"Stakeholder Architecture Mapping"
"100-Day Strategic Planning"
```

---

## **EZRA: The Corporate Platform**

### **Positioning:**

Ezra users are often high-potentials being groomed.
They're not quite your market but will be.

**Profile Angle:**

**Title:**
```
Senior Leadership Transition Architect
```

**Bio Focus:**
```
Preparing tomorrow's executives for today's complexity.

Specialization: Leaders approaching or entering their 
first executive role with P&L responsibility.

I help high-performers navigate the hidden architecture 
of executive success before failure patterns embed.

For leaders ready to think beyond competence to integration.
```

**The Long Game:**

These aren't clients today.
They're clients in 2-3 years.
Plant seeds.

# **PART IV: OPEN PLATFORM (Healthcare)**

## **ONEDOC: The Trust Platform**

### **The Unique Challenge:**

Healthcare executives have additional complexity:
- Regulatory pressure
- Life-and-death decisions
- Public scrutiny
- Professional obligations

### **Profile Positioning:**

**Title:**
```
Healthcare Executive Advisor
```

**Specialized Bio:**
```
Executive transitions in healthcare require unique navigation.

Beyond corporate complexity, healthcare executives face:
â€¢ Regulatory scrutiny
â€¢ Clinical vs. administrative tensions  
â€¢ Public accountability
â€¢ Ethical dimensions

I specialize in healthcare executive transitions where 
clinical excellence must integrate with business reality.

For Chief Medical Officers, Hospital CEOs, and healthcare 
executives managing the intersection of medicine and management.

Swiss-based. Global healthcare perspective.
```

### **The Trust Signals:**

- Reference healthcare-specific challenges
- Understand clinical/admin tension
- Respect the mission-driven aspect
- Never position as pure business

---

# **PART V: PERSONAL WEBSITE**

## **WWW.FRANCISCOBAPTISTA.COM: The Conversion Engine**

---

# **PART XV: THE INTEGRATION RULES**

1. **Use consistent visual identity**
   - Same professional photo
   - Same color palette
   - Same typography sense

2. **Reinforce core message**

   - 87% success rate
   - First 100 days focus

3. **Maintain qualification standards**
   - â‚¬50M+ P&L

   - Executive level only

4. **Drive to single action**

   - Not "get in touch"

5. **Protect positioning**

   - Never journey metaphors
   - Never inspiration content

---

# **THE MASTER PRINCIPLE:**

## **Platform Hierarchy of Purpose:**

```
WEBSITE: Converts the convinced
LINKEDIN: Validates the interested
PLATFORMS: Captures the searching
INSTAGRAM: Humanizes the methodology
BLUESKY: Positions the thinking
ONEDOC: Serves the niche

Each platform serves the whole.
No platform serves itself.
```

**The Test:**
Does this platform/post/action drive qualified executives toward assessment?

If yes: Do it.
If no: Don't.
If maybe: Default to no.

**Your digital ecosystem isn't about being everywhere. It's about being precisely where qualified executives look for validation, with exactly the message that converts their skepticism into respect, and their respect into investment.**

**Every pixel. Every word. Every platform. All driving toward one outcome:**

**A qualified executive booking a 90-minute diagnostic.**

**Everything else is vanity.**
