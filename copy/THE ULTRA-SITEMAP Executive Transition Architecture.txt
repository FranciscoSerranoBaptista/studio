# **WHAT'S DELIBERATELY MISSING:**

## **No Blog**
- You're not a thought leader
- You're a practitioner
- LinkedIn is your content platform

## **No Services Page**
- You do one thing
- It's explained on Process
- Multiple services = desperation

## **No Testimonials Page**
- Quotes are woven throughout
- Separate page feels defensive
- Quality over quantity

## **No Contact Page**
- Assessment IS contact
- No general inquiries
- Force qualification path

## **No FAQ**
- If they have questions, not qualified
- Creates doubt
- Executives don't read FAQs

## **No Team Page**
- You ARE the practice
- No false scaling
- Personal accountability

## **No Newsletter Signup**
- They either qualify or don't
- No nurture campaigns
- LinkedIn for ongoing connection

---

# **THE NAVIGATION STRUCTURE:**

## **Primary Navigation (Header):**
```
Logo/Name        About | Process | Resources | [Request Assessment]
```
- Logo links to home
- Assessment button in different color (navy)
- Disappears on mobile (hamburger menu)

## **Footer (Minimal):**
```

© 2025 | Mutual NDA | Privacy
```
- No sitemap repetition
- No newsletter signup
- No social media icons (except LinkedIn)

```

## **Path 3: Analytical (Need process understanding)**

# **THE MOBILE SITEMAP:**

```
☰ (Hamburger)
├── About
├── Process
├── Resources
└── [Assessment] (highlighted)
```

**Even simpler. No sub-pages.**

---

# **THE MAINTENANCE STRATEGY:**

**Monthly:** Update client count (200+ → 201+)
**Quarterly:** Refresh one client quote
**Annually:** Update success rate if improved
**Never:** Add pages, features, or complexity

---

# **THE GROWTH TRAP TO AVOID:**

Your site will succeed. You'll want to add:
- ❌ Blog ("thought leadership")
- ❌ Podcast page
- ❌ Speaking page
- ❌ More services
- ❌ More resources
- ❌ More anything

**Don't. Complexity kills conversion.**

---

# **THE ULTIMATE TEST:**

Can a stressed executive at 11pm on mobile:
1. Understand what you do? (5 seconds)
2. Know if they qualify? (10 seconds)
3. Take action? (15 seconds)

**If yes, ship it.**
**If no, simplify more.**

---

**This sitemap is your architecture. Five pages. One outcome. Zero confusion.**

**Everything else is ego, not strategy.**
