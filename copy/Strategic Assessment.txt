— Francisco Baptista
Executive Transition Architect
```

### **Your Pre-Session Research (30 minutes minimum):**

**LinkedIn Deep Dive:**
- Current role tenure (count the days)
- Previous role transitions (pattern recognition)
- Career trajectory (linear or zigzag?)
- Recent activity (what they're posting/commenting)
- Mutual connections (who might have referred?)

**Company Intelligence:**
- Recent organizational changes
- Stock performance/financial health
- Industry challenges
- Recent leadership changes
- Cultural reputation

**The Pre-Session Hypothesis:**
Write down your initial pattern recognition:
- Which of the 5 failure patterns they likely face
- Their probable blind spots
- Their default leadership mode
- Where they'll resist your insights

---

# **PART II: THE 90-MINUTE ARCHITECTURE**

## **Minutes 0-5: The Frame Setting**

### **The Opening:**

```
"[Name], before we begin, let me frame our 90 minutes together.

This is a diagnostic session, not a conversation. I'll be identifying patterns 
that predict success or failure in executive transitions.

You'll likely hear things that are uncomfortable. That's the value.
I'll be direct because euphemisms waste your time.

By the end, we'll both know if there's a fit for ongoing work.
But regardless, you'll leave with specific insights about your transition risks.

My commitment: Complete confidentiality and actionable truth.

Your commitment: Radical honesty about what's actually happening.

Shall we begin?"
```

### **The Authority Establishment:**

Don't explain your credentials. Demonstrate them:
- "I'm seeing a Day 47 pattern here..."
- "This is executive failure pattern number 3..."
- "In the 200+ transitions I've analyzed..."

---

## **Minutes 5-20: Context Extraction**

### **Question 1: The Situation Scanner**

```
"Give me the real story of this transition. Not the PR version.
Start with why this role exists and why you specifically are in it."
```

**Listen for:**
- Energy (where do they animate?)
- Defensiveness (what are they protecting?)
- Clarity (do they understand their mandate?)
- Time markers (how aware of the timeline?)

**Follow-up probes:**
- "Who didn't want you in this role?"
- "What narrative existed about you before Day 1?"
- "What's the unspoken expectation?"

### **Question 2: The Power Map**

```
"Walk me through who really has power in your ecosystem.
Not the org chart—the actual influence network."
```

**Draw this as they speak:**
```
        [Board]
           |
     [CEO/Boss]
       /  |  \
   [Peer][YOU][Peer]
       \  |  /
      [Team]
         |
    [Stakeholders]
```

**Follow-up probes:**
- "Who could kill your initiatives without appearing to?"
- "Who's the unofficial chief of staff?"
- "Where does budget really get decided?"

### **Question 3: The Feedback Decoder**

```
"What feedback are you getting, both directly and through behavior?
Start with what they're saying. Then what they're doing."
```

**Pattern indicators:**
- All positive = they're being managed out
- All negative = they're testing resilience
- Mixed = normal transition friction
- None = dangerous isolation

---

## **Minutes 20-35: Diagnostic Questioning**

### **The Intensity Calibration:**

```
"Describe your last three critical meetings.
How did you show up? What was the room's response?"
```

**Diagnostic markers:**
- Single-mode leadership (same energy everywhere)
- Intensity mismatch (too high/low for context)
- Emotional monochrome (missing frequencies)

**The Mirror Moment:**
```
"You're describing high intensity in every interaction.
Your strength is becoming a liability.
The room experiences you as [specific observation]."
```

### **The Competence Trap:**

```
"Where are you personally solving problems versus architecting solutions?"
```

**Red flags:**
- "I had to step in..."
- "They weren't doing it right..."
- "It was faster if I..."
- "I needed to show them..."

**The Intervention:**
```
"You're operating two levels below your role.
You were hired for judgment, not execution.
Every problem you solve personally creates organizational weakness."
```

### **The Political Blindness:**

```
"Tell me about an initiative that faced unexpected resistance."
```

**Diagnostic points:**
- Did they pre-wire support?
- Did they understand objections?
- Did they trade or just push?

**The Reality Check:**
```
"You're treating politics as optional.
At your level, politics is physics.
You can't ignore gravity."
```

---

## **Minutes 35-55: Pattern Recognition**

### **The Synthesis Statement:**

```
"Let me tell you what I'm seeing...

You're [specific observation about behavior]
Which is creating [specific organizational response]
Leading to [predicted outcome by Day 90]

This is executive failure pattern [1-5]: [Name it]

Here's what typically happens next:
[Specific prediction based on pattern]

Does this resonate with what you're experiencing?"
```

### **The Five Patterns to Diagnose:**

**Pattern 1: The Competence Trap**
```
"You're solving instead of leading.
By Day 90, you'll be seen as a senior individual contributor, not an executive.
The intervention: Immediate elevation to strategic altitude."
```

**Pattern 2: The Intensity Override**
```
"You're using one gear for all terrains.
By Day 90, you'll have organizational exhaustion.
The intervention: Emotional range expansion."
```

**Pattern 3: The Political Blindness**
```
"You're right but irrelevant.
By Day 90, you'll be isolated despite being correct.
The intervention: Influence architecture before action."
```

**Pattern 4: The Identity Crisis**
```
"You're performing instead of being.
By Day 90, you'll be exhausted from the act.
The intervention: Integration of all parts."
```

**Pattern 5: The Integration Failure**
```
"You're succeeding at work while failing at life.
By Day 90, something will break—health, family, or performance.
The intervention: Whole-life architecture."
```

### **The Resistance Moment:**

They WILL push back. That's good.

**Common Resistances:**
- "But that's what made me successful before..."
- "The organization needs to change, not me..."
- "I don't have time for politics..."
- "This is just who I am..."

**Your Response Framework:**
```
"That resistance is exactly the problem.
What got you here is now preventing what's next.
I'm not asking you to change who you are.
I'm showing you where who you are isn't serving you."
```

---

## **Minutes 55-70: Intervention Architecture**

### **The Solution Framework:**

```
"If we were to work together, here's the architecture:

Week 1-4: Intelligence Gathering
- Map real power dynamics
- Identify unwritten rules
- Decode the narrative forming about you
- Establish baseline metrics

Week 5-8: Strategic Positioning
- Adjust leadership frequency for context
- Build coalition before change
- Create early wins that matter to stakeholders
- Signal change without triggering antibodies

Week 9-12: Momentum Creation
- Make irreversible moves
- Lock in your senior team
- Establish operating rhythm
- Cement your narrative

This isn't coaching. It's systematic intervention.
```

### **The Success Metrics:**

```
"We'll measure success through:
□ Stakeholder perception shift (quantified)
□ Decision velocity improvement
□ Team engagement scores
□ Your physical stress markers
□ Board/boss confidence indicators

This is measurable, not mystical."
```

### **The Investment Framework:**

```
"The investment matches the stakes.
Your transition success is worth €XX million to the organization.
Your career trajectory is worth €XX million to you.
The investment is a fraction of the value at risk.

But we both need to be certain of fit first."
```

---

## **Minutes 70-80: Mutual Evaluation**

### **The Fit Criteria:**

```
"For this to work, I need to see:
□ Recognition that patterns need breaking
□ Willingness to examine internal architecture
□ Commitment to systematic approach
□ Energy for truth over comfort

What do you need from me to make this valuable?"
```

### **Their Common Questions:**

**"How is this different from coaching?"**
```
"Coaches help you find answers.
I tell you what's happening based on 200+ patterns.
Coaches support. I architect.
It's the difference between therapy and surgery."
```

**"What if I don't agree with your assessment?"**
```
"Then we shouldn't work together.
But consider: I have no agenda except your success.
Your organization has multiple agendas.
Whose perspective is clearer?"
```

**"How do I know this works?"**
```
"87% success rate across 200+ executives.
But more importantly: Does what I've said today resonate?
If yes, the methodology works.
If no, find someone else."
```

### **The Chemistry Check:**

```
"Beyond methodology, we'd be speaking weekly for 90 days.
Can you hear hard truths from me?
Can I be direct without you shutting down?
This is relationship as much as expertise."
```

---

## **Minutes 80-90: Next Steps**

### **The Close:**

```
"Here's what happens next:

1. You'll receive a written diagnostic within 48 hours
   - Transition complexity score
   - Three primary risk factors
   - Recommended intervention architecture
   - Investment range if we proceed

2. We both take 72 hours to evaluate fit
   - No immediate decision needed
   - This is mutual selection

3. If we both say yes, we begin immediately
   - Your 100 days are already counting down
   - Every day matters

Any questions before we close?"
```

### **The Final Frame:**

```
"Whether or not we work together, you now know:
- Which pattern you're in
- What's really at risk
- Where to focus immediately

That alone should change your next week.

I'll send the written diagnostic within 48 hours.
Take time to consider if systematic intervention makes sense."
```

# **PART V: ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES**

## **The Microexpression Reading:**

### **During Video Assessment:**

**Watch for these tells:**

**The Defensive Microsecond:**
- Slight backward lean when challenged
- Indicates pattern hitting home
- Push gently here

**The Recognition Flash:**
- Eyebrows raise briefly
- They see the pattern
- Expand on this point

**The Resistance Jaw:**
- Jaw tightens before speaking
- They're formulating defense
- Preempt with "I know you want to say..."

**The Truth Exhale:**
- Deep breath after admission
- They're ready for real work
- This is your green light

---

## **The Question Architecture:**

### **Never Ask:**
- "How's it going?" (too open)
- "What are your challenges?" (too generic)
- "How can I help?" (too servile)
- "What would success look like?" (too consultant-speak)

### **Always Ask:**
- "Who's threatened by your success?"
- "What feedback are you not hearing?"
- "Where are you lying to yourself?"
- "What pattern from your last role is repeating?"
- "If you fail, what will have caused it?"

---

## **The Resistance Patterns:**

### **Type 1: The Intellectual**
*"Interesting framework, but every situation is unique..."*

Response: "You're using complexity to avoid seeing patterns.
That's executive failure pattern #4."

### **Type 2: The Victim**
*"The organization is so political/difficult/broken..."*

Response: "Every executive who failed said that.
The ones who succeeded worked with reality."

### **Type 3: The Hero**
*"I just need to work harder/smarter/faster..."*

Response: "Effort without architecture is exhaustion.
You're already working hard enough."

### **Type 4: The Skeptic**
*"I don't believe in frameworks..."*

Response: "Perfect. Don't believe. Just observe.
Does what I'm describing match your experience?"

# **PART VII: THE MASTERY MOVES**

## **Advanced Diagnostic Techniques:**

### **The Prediction Power Move:**

```
"Based on what you've told me, here's what will happen:
- Next week, [specific prediction]
- Within 30 days, [specific prediction]
- By Day 90, [specific prediction]

Watch for these. When they happen, you'll know
the pattern is real."
```

When predictions come true, they're locked in.

### **The Permission Moment:**

```
"Can I tell you something that might be uncomfortable?"
[They always say yes]
"You're creating the very resistance you're fighting against."
[Pause for impact]
```

### **The Mirror Technique:**

```
"Let me play back what I'm hearing...
[Repeat their words with slight pattern emphasis]
Do you hear it now?"
```

### **The Binary Choice:**

```
"You have two paths:
Continue current trajectory → 40% chance of success
Systematic intervention → 87% chance of success

There's no third option where trying harder works."
```

# **PART X: THE EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE**

## **Managing Your Own Psychology:**

### **Before the Assessment:**

**The Mindset:**
- I'm diagnosing, not selling
- They need clarity more than comfort
- Truth serves them even if they resist
- I might reject them

**The Preparation:**
- Review your pattern document
- Clear your previous client from mind
- Set intention for truth-telling
- Remember: You're the expert

### **During the Assessment:**

**If They Resist:**
Think: "The resistance confirms the pattern"
Not: "I'm losing them"

**If They Collapse:**
Think: "Truth is working"
Not: "I've gone too far"

**If They Argue:**
Think: "They're processing"
Not: "They don't respect me"

### **After the Assessment:**

**The Debrief:**
- What patterns did I see?
- Where did I hesitate?
- What truth did I withhold?
- Would I want to work with them?

**The Recovery:**
- 10-minute walk (clear their energy)
- Write hot wash notes
- Send calendar hold for follow-up
- Move to next task

---

# **PART XV: THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**

## **After Every Assessment:**

### **Track These Metrics:**

**Quantitative:**
- Did they book? (Y/N)
- Did they show? (Y/N)
- Did they engage? (1-10)
- Did they convert? (Y/N)
- Investment level? (€)

**Qualitative:**
- What pattern presented?
- Where did I hesitate?
- What surprised me?
- What would I change?

### **Monthly Review:**
- Conversion rate (should be 40-60%)
- Average investment (should increase)
- Pattern distribution (should vary)
- Energy required (should decrease)

---

# **THE MASTER KEY:**

## **Remember This Above All:**

You're not trying to win them.
You're trying to diagnose them.

You're not selling transformation.
You're revealing patterns.

You're not promising success.
You're architecting probability.

They don't need to like you.
They need to trust your expertise.

The assessment isn't a sales tool.
It's a diagnostic instrument that happens to convert 40-60% of qualified executives because truth, delivered with precision, is valuable enough to invest in.

---

**This is your complete playbook. 90 minutes that change their trajectory—or reveal why it won't work. Either outcome serves everyone.**

**The only failure is comfort without clarity.**
